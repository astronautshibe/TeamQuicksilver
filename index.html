              <h1 class="arrow">Overview</h1>
              <p>This is a <a href="#">VR application</a>. that helps individuals in a calming environment that teaches everyday, useful tasks and allows users to practise them until they feel confident to use the learned skills in real life, appealing to the young and old across various activities, this app provides a plethora of activities for all demographics to interact with to either learn or build upon skills. Users can interact with their surroundings with real world physics with useful tips, calming music and a simplistic user interface to navigate through the tasks at hand. It appeals to tactile learners where involvement engages interest and you can see a finished product which encourages a sense of achievement.

                <p>This project will be developed in a games engine and aims to be as accessible as possible for many different demographics. Steps needed to implement to create this app from start to finish would be to create a team. This team would need people with C# programming skills, experience with unity, sound design, 3d modelling skills and game designer skills, these individuals would all need knowledge of github and git to appropriately add their contributions to the project. Moving forward, the team would need to come up with a plan to discuss how the app would look involving the user interface, graphics, activities to include and device interfacing, surveying demographics to see which skills are in demand to learn, data recording and promotions to consider. The development would be extensive, starting with motion capture of objects, the team would need to to capture human movement, time real-life activities, have approximate measures of real-life objects, record sounds and also record and test how to do each activity accurately. </p>

                <p>This information can then be imported into the digital project and the work on 3D modelling and programming can commence. This would involve extensive play-testing amongst the team and external opinions from individuals not on the team to give another point of view. All this development is not without costs as people do need income for their time, it would be good to consider creating a short demo to demonstrate for a fundraiser or to pitch to companies to invest in to fairly compensate the team and to also fund advertisement. Upon completion, the project would need to be posted onto an online game shop. Steam would be an ideal site to host as it is the most universally used games digital distribution service (Prescott, S, 2019) which would increase reachability for sales and access. This game would need frequent updates to accommodate activity requests and to import new devices and their interfaces as they become available to keep up with the technology.</p>

                <p>A sample of 2000 millennials surveyed in 2018 by Airtasker, 50% admit they struggle with everyday tasks. Some of the data also records specific tasks that the sample group were not confident in doing such as 84% admit they are not confident in changing a lightbulb and 82% would not be confident cleaning a car. [1] User John Challis mentioned there is a disconnect between the elderly and technology (Challis, J. 2016). How do we close that gap? A very real issue that many can relate to experiencing, especially showing the elderly how to use technology and apps. These staggering numbers are increasing as priorities shift to pursuing full time education and work from a young age and young people are leaving home later which generally negates the need for household tasks as parents usually handle those and thus the skills are not learned. As technology evolves at such a rapid rate, elderly people struggle to keep up, as well as technology having costs associated with it, it’s unreasonable to expect elderly persons to keep buying technology in order to keep up with it. That’s where the need for such an application to fill those gaps comes in.

                <h1 class="arrow">Description</h1>
                <p>The proposed program is an <a href="#">interactive educational game </a>. for all ages to relax and enjoy while learning helpful skills for everyday tasks. While simulators are not a new concept, simulators used for these particular activities are lacking. Flight simulators are a cost effective way for pilots to gain experience with little to no risks, why not apply that to everyday activities. This app can even be applied to learning a new hobby without using the funds to purchase the materials and equipment for something that the user may not even end up enjoying. Not everyone is afforded the same life experiences and education on skills that are considered to be taught outside of school which is where this program comes in. While using search engines to learn how to do everyday things has been helpful, there’s no substitute for hands-on experience. This interactive skills simulator offers an option to those who are tactile learners where watching a video and reading instructions may not provide the most effective form of educational delivery.

                <p>Many instruction booklets that come with devices usually have very small fonts which are difficult to read and don’t always have answers for specific things you are trying to do as they are a general guide. When trying to experiment with navigating devices, it can be easy to accidentally make a phone call or post something publicly, so with helpful prompts that let the user know what each button does at whatever pace the user likes, users can experiment and try things without the concern of dramatically changing a device or the public seeing their mishaps. Tools and supplies can be expensive and in some tasks you risk injury without supervision from an experienced individual or you risk causing damage to items if you try to repair them. This app aims to provide a cost effective means for learning as most people have access to a computer with minimum specifications to run virtual reality or a basic game in general. The program utilises virtual reality where the user can explore their environment, pick up items and use items to complete tasks that they can then apply to the real world. Skills that can be investigated include but are not limited to mending clothes, changing a tire, lawn mowing, house painting, woodwork, patching a hole in a wall, putting air in tires, and cleaning. Features and considerations to be made include but are not limited to:
                </p>

                <p>Making sure the game is accessible, ensuring the resolutions are not too intense so graphics and physics are not too demanding on equipment.</p>

                <p>A non-virtual reality mode for those who do not own VR capable equipment</p>

                <p>Simplistic user interface to cater for a wide variety of age demographics as too much stylising can be distracting and confusing. Too many options can be overwhelming.</p>

                <p>A calming environment with relaxing ambient and positive encouraging prompts</p>

                <p>Available in multiple languages thus furthering accessibility</p>

                <p>This game helps individuals learn helpful everyday life skills in a controlled environment. Where changing a tire and sewing can be hazardous if you don’t know what you’re doing, this game provides an area in which to learn. Many people can be ashamed to ask to learn these skills as they are generally viewed as skills parents should have already taught you or as an elderly person, have not grown up with such technologies and were never shown how to use things. It is unreasonable to expect any person to buy multiple smart devices just to learn how to use them, with different brands usually coming with different user interfaces, it would be helpful to navigate and try before buying to see which is the most intuitive for a person before buying. This program provides a shame-free area to practise. It will have real world physics to emulate the movement of objects using the Unity engine. This product will be available in steam which is a digital distribution service to allow for worldwide delivery. Technological devices will be updated into the system so users can select their devices or potential devices and get familiar with the interface and capabilities.

                  <p>For the most efficient results, a team would need to be formed to cover the large amount of aspects involved with creation. To develop the game the software involved would be a physics engine such as Unity should be used, 3D modelling software such as blender, use of an IDE to program in, most likely Microsoft visual studio. A physics shader such as ShaderToy will need to be used. Where music is involved, sound equipment and music editing software, a microphone for recording voice-overs,. The development team would also need a VR headset and a pc with minimum capabilities to support VR and render 3D images.</p>

                  <p>The skills required are knowledge of C# programming language to be used in Visual studios in conjunction with Unity. Scripts will need to be written for the game. The developers will need to know how to model and render 3D images and program physics shaders using OPenGL shading language. It would not be difficult to find the resources online to learn such programming as many resources and tutorials exist online. The software involved and mentioned are all free to the public. Unity however becomes a paid service when an individual or organisation earns more than $100K per annum but is otherwise free. Most people own a PC capable of running basic games and basic VR is available even on smart mobile phones which can be inserted into a headset which is an affordable and feasible means of using VR technology. Audacity is a free and highly capable sound editing app which will reduce costs associated with development, thus decreasing the prices that need to be passed onto the user. Instruments and sound recording tools can be hired however it can be costly over time and it requires prior knowledge of instrumental skills. It’s definitely an option if needing to be considered however royalty-free music is available and if voice-overs are necessary, a microphone is all that’s needed</p>

                    <p>People old and young alike wanting to learn or improve skills will be able to do so from the comfort of their own home, organisations can implement this technology in educational settings to provide another method of learning. If successful, the need for expenditure for tools and equipment to learn these skills will not be necessary which will save people money, time and space and people will be confident trying out the tasks and know what equipment is needed if they ever come across an issue. This development will hopefully build a more confident community and enable people to have the ability to help others if their neighbours or friends need a hand. People will have the option to save money on hiring a handy person which is beneficial to those on a budget especially in an economy where the cost of living has skyrocketed.</p>

                    <p>Jinesh identified Web Developer as his ideal job. In burning glass data, it does not rank however Web Analyst does rank at #144. This could be a way into a Web Developer Job. The required skills for Web Development are HTML ranked 14 in Skills in Demand, JavaScrip skills (3rd in Demand), SQL Skills (1st in Demand). There are other skills required which are not listed in the Skills Demand database which are Analytic Skills, Responsive Design, Interpersonal Skills, Testing and debugging, Back-end basics, and Search Engine Optimization.
                    After reviewing the Dataset, the ideal job did change for Jinesh, however it did show that some low demand skills are required also to be able to obtain the job. Since web developing is not ranked high in the demand job the Web Analyst is now his ideal job.</p>

                    <p>Shalimay identified her ideal job to be a Game Developer. This specific title does not appear in the ranked system of the Burning glass data however ‘Developer’ does appear at number 23 on the ranked list of job demand titles. Many skills involved with game development such as programming in C languages and using git can be translated easily into these in-demand jobs such as JAVA, a C language, ranks highly in demand for JAVA developer, Solutions Architect and Java Developer. All appearing in the top 10 of the top titles.

                    Of the ranks in the Top IT Skills data, Microsoft C# ranks at #7, Git ranks at #12, and Visual Basic at #44. Having assessed the data, Shalimay’s opinions have not changed as the goals for Game Developer as an occupation as this drive was more interest and hobby-driven rather than job stability in the industry of IT. It’s just happenstance that the cross-over skills are in high demand.</p>

                    <p>Skills required to be a senior Developer rank 29 in the burning glass data. Demand is extremely high. Skills Bens currently possess rank very low in terms of being valuable and work ready for an employer. The three highest ranked skill I need to acquire to be a senior game developer are multiple languages Java/JEE, Spring, JSON, XML, REST, NoSQL Database (MongoDB, Cassandra), Distributed System, RDBMS, ePub3, MVC frameworks, Design Patterns, Javascript, JQuery, GWT, JSON.

                      Moreover, extensive knowledge of C# using Visual Studio using Webforms, MVC and Entity Framework. Furthermore, Experience as an applications programmer on large-scale data base management systems and this is just the tip of the iceberg. None of the top-ranking skill required are currently in Bens's skill set. After exploring the burning glass data ben's opinion remains the same, He is still really driven to become a senior game developer this is because even if I come up short, He will gain many important skills along the way.</p>

                        <h2>Jineshkumar Pandya</h2>
                        <p>Jinesh was Born in India but has been living in Australia since he was ten. Mainly he uses his native language which is Gujarati at home but since he has been here since the age of ten, feels like English is his first language. Jinesh currently works as a Computer Technician (Hardware) in Port Melbourne. A fun fact about Jinesh is that he learnt French when he was in High School and won second prize in a French Speaking competition.

                          Jinesh’s interest in IT started when he first got a laptop for school. Jinesh always wondered how these machines worked and how all the different components came together. When it comes to repairing laptops, Jinesh broke the charging port in his own laptop. When he saw how the technician was fixing /repairing the motherboard, he was excited to get his hands onto fixing laptops. After Jinesh completed Year 11, he built his own PC and has wanted to work with computers since then.

                          Jinesh chose to come to RMIT as before he started working full time as a Computer Technician, he studied at RMIT on campus towards a Certificate IV in IT. From studying Introduction to IT, Jinesh wishes to learn the basics of HTML and to learn how to get a website up and running. As he wants to be a Web Developer, this is the perfect place to get new information and study how websites are made.</p>

                        <h2>Shalimay Nichols</h2>
                        <p>Shalimay is half Filipino and half Australian. Although she grew up in Australia, Shalimay still embraces the Filipino culture and celebrates their events and traditions. Shalimay graduated high school in 2014 and decided to work in dental assisting where she obtained certification and worked for four years. Although a really interesting and rewarding field to be in, Shalimay’s interest in games began to grow into something more of what she wanted to start a career in. Shalimay studied a Diploma of Game Development which gave her a fundamental understanding of programming which has then led her to study a bachelor of IT at RMIT university. In her spare time, Shalimay likes to either sew, play games with her friends, go for hikes, watch game playthroughs or learn something new. She also has three guinea pigs and a cat which keep her very busy.

                        Shalimay’s IT interest started from games. Shalimay wanted to know how they worked and how they were made so maybe one day she could make my own. Whilst learning programming she had a realisation that this is the future. That if she doesn't learn something that so heavily influences the world around us, she would get left behind. Shalimay feels she must adapt to the world around her and future-proof herself. So, it’s lucky in a way it’s genuinely something she enjoys and is interested in. Shalimay likes efficiency. If there’s an easier way to do things, she wants to know or be able to figure it out. She also likes to design things and IT covers all aspects of these interests as IT includes everything from making things work to creating the user experience.

                        Although limited, Shalimay’s experience in IT mainly stems from game development. Shalimay has had a lot of involvement in the process of developing games like creating the UI (User Interface), creating stories, programming, developing the user experience, learning how to use different software such as GitHub, Blender, Visual Studio, Unity, SourceTree, Photoshop, and Audacity. Shalimay has done some game testing; she has recorded and presented data in spreadsheets that explains whether a game is balanced or not and she has very briefly touched on artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>

                        <h2>Benjamin Duke</h2>
                        <p>Ben was born and raised in country Victoria. In his younger years, his parents worked on sheep farms. Around age 9-14 Andy’s father managed pig farms. As a result, Ben was home schooled from grade 5 until re-entering school halfway through year 10. Ben did not complete year 10 and moved straight into work as a retail assistant where he completed ten years in various roles.

                          A hobby of Ben’s to this day which began at an early age is gym, health and fitness. This led to the next detour in Ben’s life. Ben completed Certificates 3 and 4 in Personal Training and became a CrossFit powerlifting coach/Personal Trainer. This led to him working for a CrossFit gym which he eventually managed for a further three years. However, that business was sold so he decided to change direction in life again and head back into retail whilst beginning the journey to get into university. This journey began by completing approximately two years of steps which began with him swapping and changing degrees. However, Ben has finally started a degree he is ready to sink his teeth into at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). A fun fact about Ben is that he likes to mountain bike - specifically downhill mountain biking. Ben has also been sky diving and likes to think he’s a bit of a thrill-seeker.

                          Ben’s interest in IT did not begin until later in life due to not having a PC (personal computer) until around the age of 12. His interest was first peaked around the age of 18 when his best mate decided to undertake an IT degree. Up to that point he had never considered university or further study to be a possibility. However, it was still approximately another decade before he would decide to make the jump into further study. By this time his best mate had begun what is now a successful career with the Department of Defence as a Network Engineer. Along the way he developed an excellent group of friends with a passionate interest in IT. Furthermore, if that was not already enough to push him in the direction of IT, Ben's current girlfriend and soon-to-be wife (fingers crossed) also has a passion for game development and has recently completed a Diploma in game development. She is now also embarking on a journey to complete a degree in IT. With all this passion and interest in IT all around him, it was only a matter of time before Ben's interest was a sparked to the point where he would enrol in this current degree with RMIT.

                          Ben’s experience in IT is limited although he enjoys playing games and talking to his mates about it. Although Ben's tech skills are limited, he does however possess many crossover skills from multiple team leadership roles in his earlier careers. For example, he has a strong skill set in conflict resolution, team motivation, and overall time management of large group-oriented tasks. This experience is due to the multiple management roles he has held over the years.</p>
