              <h1>Project Description</h1>
              <h1 class="arrow">Overview</h1>
              <h2>Topic</h2>
              <p>The purpose of our application is to demonstrate a simple task to the general public
                  For example, changing a car Tyre this may seem like a simple task to someone who
                   knows how to do it but like all things in life what is simple to one person is an unknown
                  For another the purpose of the application is to draw attention and bridge the gap
                  Between knowing and not knowing while doing so the aim is education and exploration
                  The education will come from a well-designed application which will take the
                   user through a step-by-step journey while educating them on how to complete the
                   task in a safe and efficient manner. Furthermore, exploration comes from the
                  Vast number of tasks you will be able to select from within the application which will
                  lead you down a vast rabbit hole of new experience and tasks to learn </p>

                  <h2>Motivation</h2>
                  <p>The purpose of our application is to demonstrate a simple task to the general public
                    For example, changing a car Tyre this may seem like a simple task to someone who

                    <h2>Landscape</h2>
                    <p>While simulators are not a new concept, these specific tasks are currently under-represented in the market.
                      Similar products in regards to every-day tasks range from cooking simulator using virtual Reality on the computer,
                      lawnmower simulator, cooking  mama series and babypals available on Nintendo DS systems.
                      However these products only cater to one specific task and are unregulated. Games available on the Nintendo ds system are catered towards a very young demographic who do not care for accuracy of tasks, and time-accuracy however do learn some genral skills from these games. Lawnmower simulator and cooking simulator although works in real time, are only available on consoles and on the computer which are not easily portable like a mobile phone.</p>

                    <h1>Detailed Description</h1>
                    <h2>Aims</h2>
                    <p>The aim of the app is to provide a regulated and simple design for individuals wanting to learn a new practical skill via safe and interactive means. It would do this by having animations and activities that the user can interact like a real life task simulation. Ideally the app would be regulated by a governing body to avoid misinformation spread around the internet e.g. mixing cleaning chemicals suggested by forums or even working on a car. This app also aims to be accessible by being available on mobile platforms so users can use the app wherever they go.

                      The most crucial aspect of the project is appeal of the app. Without functionality and a visually appealing user interface, users would have very little motivations to navigate this app. Therefore an emphasis on art design and programming should be paramount to the project. Without attention to detail, it runs the risk of being unrealistic, immature, rushed or unprofessional which is the opposite of the original goal to deliver realism and a regulated app that people can trust to learn proper methods.

                      With a limited timeframe for project delivery, the focus should be on the art. Initially limit the number of tasks on the app to solely focus on delivering the best experience to the user as possible with potential to add more later if it’s highly successful. This is to reduce costs of time and money so efforts can be focused elsewhere if the restraints call for it. The user doesn’t see all the backend efforts and will only judge the art style and experience which they will judge by the art style and interface layout. However, a balance between having too little content will need to be considered. </p>

                    <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
                    <h3>Original Plan</h3>
                    <p>The initial plan was the delivery of a VR application available on the pc and some mobile devices with VR capabilities however the practical aspect of development within such time constraints and a heavily reduced team was unrealistic. The initial plan involved a team of individuals in roles such as 3D modelling, programming, UI and UX design and animators. This was an enormous task to coordinate with 3 people in the team who would have to learn all aspects developing a game in software unfamiliar to them.  With one person in the group familiar with C# and software associated with 3D games, this would cause the responsibility of the project to be solely allocated to one person and leave the other team members out of their ability to contribute and fairly allocate workload given that the documentation is also a team contribution where as many people as possible need to be working on it.  Logistically it was not reasonable to expect others to learn C# from scratch to contribute to the functional project.  </p>

                    <h3>Research Task</h3>
                    <p>During the research tasks to consider if the 3D game was even possible. It was discovered the multitude of free 3D assets available to work and experiment with. Many YouTube videos were available to demonstrate how to work with 3D models and bring them to life we helpful and gave the team inspiration for development of the game to consider if the right conditions were met I.e. time, adequate team members and market demand. As a team it was discussed the logistics of getting a reasonable prototype done as well as the documentation and it was a unanimous decision that it was not possible by the due date.  </p>

                    <h3>Emergency reconsideration of the app and logistics</h3>
                    <p>The research tasks had been met for the initial plan and had been discovered to not be viable for this assignment and a different idea was proposed. The new idea was of a similar nature however it was to be a mobile phone application. The group had agreed and discussed what software would be suitable and research tasks were given.  </p>

                    <h3>Introduction of figma </h3>
                    <p>Figma had been suggested as an app prototyping tool. Figma is a UI/UX app prototyping tool designed for the desktop with a corresponding phone application to test the vision of the project. It is much less complicated than Unity and required no knowledge of C#. The group was happy to initiate using Figma to design the app and it would allow others to work on it simultaneously and also to allocate more workload to others. Figma is also centralized in the way that teams can work on it simultaneously in real time.  </p>

                    <h3>Further Research</h3>
                    <p>Figma was experimented with and was decided to use the iPhone X/11 layout as the newer iPhone models have the same dimensions and it was found that in April of 2022, the Apple iPhone 13  was the best-selling phone in the USA (TEAM COUNTERPOINT, 2019). It was decided that the best course of action is to start adapting for the newer models as the older layouts are gradually being phased out. A basic prototype was made to learn the basics of figma. This was then tested on mobile to see if was able to be interacted with and to test whether it would be an appropriate deliverable for the assignment and it was successful. Considerations of using a YouTube video in place of the interactive animations for the meantime were made. The group will work on the art for the app to give it a nice, polished touch.  Knowing the capabilities, learning new software and becoming more confident in the time constraints, the group had discussed the tasks which would initially exist on the app. Factors to consider were: </p>
                    <p>Demand - What is the most important skill or skills which most people should know but don’t </p>
                    <p>Danger – What is a DIY task outside of legal obligation to hire a professional to do </p>
                    <p>Thrifty – Very simple things that would cost a lot to not do yourself </p>
                    <p>It was determined that one from each criteria would be a good demonstration of concepts as a lot of tasks would fit a lot of these descriptions simultaneously.

                      For Demand, cooking is somewhat of a dying art due to convenience and availability of takeaway and less time. Danger would be changing a car tire as if done incorrectly, can cause serious injury and occasionally death (Stephens, 2016), for thrifty, sewing buttons is an incredibly easy task which a lot of people cannot do and pay others to repair clothes.

                      These three tasks are to be implemented into the early development and concept of the prototype. </p>

                    <h3>Art concepts </h3>
                    <p>Concept art was created as a placeholder for the interactive animations to yet be determined to insert into the app. Krita, a free digital art software application was used to create this concept art. It provided a lot of features that would also be available in photoshop without the cost or license fees required. This was handy to know as the license Krita provides is a general public license which allows the use of this software for any purpose including professional work.  </p>

                    <h3>Expansion on the app</h3>
                    <p>The pictures were imported into the project and the idea was to click the picture and it would move to the next step, as if to almost replicate interacting with the task which would then load the next animation, however the concept we were trying to replicate wasn’t quite the vision we had hoped for. Gifs were imported into the app to emulate animation which worked nicely as a placeholder.  </p>

                    <h3>Final Touches</h3>
                    <p>The app was completed and tested numerous times by the group, the buttons were functional, the layout was simple and easy to use, text and animation holders were functional, and the group was happy with how the prototype turned out. The group also discussed colour schemes, logo, button placement and background and it was incorporated into the final prototype. </p>

                    <h2>Roles</h2>
                    <p>Roles identified in this project so far have been coordinator, lead designer and lead developer. With all the roles and tasks assigned, ultimately it was determined that the team could work on it entirely however progress and design elements were to be decided by one person.

                      A coordinator would be necessary to centralize allocation of tasks and to be the sole manager of the tasks. This is an implementation from A2 where every week was a new chair to allocate tasks however this allowed for blame games to happen amongst others when too many people were responsible for everything. It would just be easier to have someone manage one specific task as it is easier to track your own work and remember what has been done.

                      If there are any disagreements to be had or conflicts in ideas, the lead designer is the final decision-maker in all these concepts and is  necessary to avoid any grey-areas of leadership or unassigned leader, the lead designer will make the decisions of how the app looks, and the user experience.

                      The developer would be solely responsible for the development of the app. While others can also work on it, it’s the responsibility of the lead developer to oversee the development process and be the biggest contributor of the task.  </p>
                <h2>Scopes and Limits</h2>
                <p>Given the analysis of the group’s skills and time constraints, it was determined to be unreasonable to deliver the original project of a 3D interactive game. Leaving the project in its original state would mean a massive workload specified to one person which would not be fair. To make things even, it would mean other members would need to learn how to use Unity, Blender, light shaders, C# and sound software which is also an incredibly massive task. To fit within time constraints and to be realistic about the project, the only solution was to reconsider the project and its delivery to scale down the skills and effort required. The introduction of more intuitive software such as Figma required less research time and very little learning curve by comparison to the other project.

                The original project would have taken a huge amount of time to just demonstrate one task feature for the user to try  whereas this other approach we could sacrifice the virtual immersion to focus on delivering more features to present with the app.  Here we can try to deliver 5 tasks with moderate visuals or 1 task with adequate visuals and functionality but very little contribution from others. With a reduced workload and ability for others to contribute, people are also able to voice their ideas realistically, take over where necessary and even introduce other features that others may not have discovered in the software. </p>
                <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p></p>

                <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>Figma allows for UI testing as one of its features. This allows for testing on IOS devices in the dimensions the app was designed in. A very basic skeleton of the app would need to be developed purely for the functionality and to gather a general idea of the app’s design, the functionality would be tested by the developers and external sources, it would also need to be explained to the external sources that it is a very basic prototype. From there the final design can be implemented.

                 Other testing that needs to take place is external testing to gather opinions from people not involved with the development as it’s easy to navigate the app if you’ve designed it which does not give an accurate representation of intuitive interactivity. Gathering external opinions also allows for another perspective in which feedback on feature additions that may not be obvious to developers, but the general public would need. It feels appropriate that 3 external sources would be needed to test the app ideally with experience in this area. Each could be assigned specific features to comment on such as art, functionality and design. Assigning 3 people would reduce the workload for feedback of the entire app, cause less testers exhaustion and the feedback can come from a place of experience.

                The app would need to be tested on multiple OS versions and multiple software versions. It must be noted that the app would need constant maintenance and testing as software updates are rolled out.

                We will know the testing is successful when the app runs smoothly I.e., the app runs on its own not in an emulator, it does not crash or glitch, it’s fast and intuitive and the feedback is that it is intuitive, eye-catching and that it evokes a positive feeling in the users.  </p>

                <h2>Timeframe</h2>
                <img src="img/timeframe.JPG" alt="Timeframe table">


                <h2>Risks</h2>
                <p>There are a multitude of issues that can be encountered developing this app including time management, budget issues, lack of skillset and marketing issues, unexpected software licensing changes, regulation rejection

                  Specifically pertaining to this project and the people involved with it, there is a lack of experience with developing an app from the bottom up. It is currently unknown how long realistically it would take to develop this application with all its features across multiple platforms. The risk would be that if given a certain deadline, that the deadline would not be met due to the lack of experience in the timeframes, maybe the software is too difficult to learn, the art aspect could be more difficult than previously thought, programming could be incredibly difficult to learn and to maintain in the app. This could be mitigated with organizing an experienced team however that increases the costs involved.

                  Budgeting could be an issue even with an experienced team. Hiring a team and compensating testers is costly. The project could encounter many hurdles that the team could not prepare for despite all the planning (e.g. complicated code for features) that would increase the time necessary for team members and testers that unless were contracted for a certain amount, would need to be compensated financially. It wouldn’t be unlikely that a legal team would need to be involved as this app has been planned to be regulated or also give advice on dangerous tasks which is a costly matter and of unknown amounts as it is a case-by-case basis. There would also be costs involved with advertising and marketing of unknown amounts, which would also be a risk. The risk involved is that despite a budget, it’s likely that unexpected costs that despite the best efforts of research, could occur and put the project into jeopardy.

                  Marketing risks involve not only cost, but also misjudgment of demand. There is a risk that the app might not do as well as intended due to the demand not being as high as initially thought. Even with experienced testers, they are three people’s opinions against the general public’s, three people is an unfair sample size to compensate for the majority.  </p>

                  <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
                  <p>The group will maintain communication via weekly meetings using Microsoft Teams via video call. At least twice a week is appropriate where one takes place earlier in the week to assign tasks and one later to update on progress and discuss success/hurdles. The chat feature in Microsoft teams allows for more casual conversation that group members can view conversations when it suits their time as with busy schedules, webcam meetings aren’t always a viable option. If a group member is consistently unreachable and not responding in Microsoft Teams, members should be emailed, it could very well be possible the member may be using MS teams in the browser rather than the desktop app and may not be getting notifications. I would also give them my contact details for them to get in touch. </p>

      <p>Web Developer is a role to ensure the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are responsible for website’s performance and capacity. Web Development falls under three categories, Back-end developers, Front-end Developers, and full-stack developers (courserea, Aug 3,2022). Some responsibilities of web-developer are Designing user interface and navigation menus, writing and reviewing code for sites (HTML, JavaScript, XML), testing web applications. Summary for each category is listed below: </p>

      <p>Back-end Developer: Role is to create website’s structure, write code, and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also include managing access points for others who need to manage a website's content.  </p>

      <p>Front-end Developer: Role is to work on the visual part of the website, also part of user interface group. They Design the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site. </p>

      <p>Full-stack Developer: Role is to work both back-end and front-end development. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team.  </p>

      <p>Senior Game Developer is a role where they are responsible for overseeing all aspects of development, from concept to completion. This Includes everything from managing a team of Programmers and artist to creating detailed design document that outline how a game should look and play. A senior game developer have wide range of responsibilities which can include: Developing new game features based on design requirements and specifications, Maintaining source code control through version control systems such as CVS or Perforce, Reviewing design documents and providing feedback to the designer before coding begins, Writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining code that is written in one or more computer programming languages, Designing new features for existing games or creating new games from scratch, Testing new releases of the game for bugs and other problems before they are released to the public, Creating art assets such as textures and character models for use in game development, providing support for customers who encounter issues with a game after it has been released, Collaborating with other members of the development team such as artists, programmers, producers, and audio engineers. </p>

      <p> Game Developer role comes under the role of “Senior Game Developer”, but they have less responsibilities than the senior developer. These developers are to create and design game software and are involved in almost every aspect of game production, from the initial connect phase through to the final testing. “A game developers’ main duty is to translate ideas and game requirements into code.” (Betterteam, 2022).  Some of the responsibilities of game developer are: Creating initial storylines and character biographies, Constructing the game base engine, contributing to the audio and graphic design, creating game specifications and operating instructions, translating ideas into efficient code, generating storyboards and game scripts, maintaining code and fixing game bugs, animating game characters and environment. </p>

      <p> There are not many common elements between Web Developer and Game Developer/Senior Game Developer. All job roles require different sets of qualifications, and different career paths down the road. The only jobs that are on same career path are Game Developer and Senior Game Developer. One element that is common in all three job roles is the requirement of HTML Knowledge. HTML is a MUST requirement for these job roles as somewhere in their daily duties it requires them to use it. From Senior Game developer and Game developer using it to check code, to Web Developer using it to develop its website. The requirement of each position is different from its Education Qualifications, previous work experience. Senior Game developer and Game developer have similar education requirements but when it comes to past work experience to be able to gain Senior position, the applicant must have 5+ Years in the field to be eligible for the job. Web Developer is a starting position which can change to Senior Web Developer with experience (3 to 5 years of experience is required to get Senior web developer).

              <p>
                Our group had many strong points. Firstly, our group excelled and taking a positive approach to the assignment which was representered by the many interactions in chat, team meetings to help each other out at times of struggle meaning the group members had commitments outside of uni, the other members of the group had no problems taking on more work load to help out with the overall success of the project group in mind. Secondly, what was surprising about our group was that after we were split into two groups of three it seems that even though the workload was larger overall the total process seemed mach smoother and achievable with a greater feeling of support from the group overall, reflecting on this it may just be due to the smaller size of the group making it easier to communicate and allowing for more meaningful interactions. Furthermore,one of the big things discovered about this group work is that the wrong personality types really clash, this can get to the point where the issues seem to be unresolvable, it is something that should definitely considered in the future this is due to feeling like the group of three was far more efficient than a group of six where there was a major clash of personalities which lead to more time being wasted trying to resolve issues with the group instead of focusing on the assignment at hand. After the completion of this assignment the thing would be of most value to the group moving forward is to discuss the project as a whole at the very beginning so that as people completed tasks they would all share a similar structured with formatting fonts etc this would overall increase the groups productivity. Moreover, this would allow other group members to take over a task at any point if due to any reason it needed to be handed off, this would also increase the efficiency of the group as a whole.

              <p>My perception of the group as a whole is mixed across both assignment 2 and 3 both assignments were chalk and cheese in my opinion assignment to began with a group of six eager participants all looking to work together and engage in the course content but as the group began to need to solve problems and delegate work and communicate the individual personalities began to show through. For example some members were impatient some were too relaxed, some cared more about getting the work done, others were more concerned about the overall quality of the work this lead to major heated discussion on group contribution and the quality of the contribution and also how each group member should be reflected in the overall marks. Reflection on this I personally only think this hurt the group as a whole and well actually was the end of the group as it needed to be split into 2 groups of three to move forward. However, moving forward as a group of three was a complete turn around the group even though smaller, felt they achieved a great result and final assessment with much better team work overall. However, this was just probably due to smaller group less personality clashes. Moving forward I feel I need to make adjustments in working in larger groups moving forward I would try different tactics in getting the best from people I feel if a group needs to be split the group has failed and as I am apart of the group some of that responsibility lies with me, something I could definitely do is work on my conflic resolution.</p>

                        <h2>Jineshkumar Pandya</h2>
                        <p>Jinesh was Born in India but has been living in Australia since he was ten. Mainly he uses his native language which is Gujarati at home but since he has been here since the age of ten, feels like English is his first language. Jinesh currently works as a Computer Technician (Hardware) in Port Melbourne. A fun fact about Jinesh is that he learnt French when he was in High School and won second prize in a French Speaking competition.

                          Jinesh’s interest in IT started when he first got a laptop for school. Jinesh always wondered how these machines worked and how all the different components came together. When it comes to repairing laptops, Jinesh broke the charging port in his own laptop. When he saw how the technician was fixing /repairing the motherboard, he was excited to get his hands onto fixing laptops. After Jinesh completed Year 11, he built his own PC and has wanted to work with computers since then.

                          Jinesh chose to come to RMIT as before he started working full time as a Computer Technician, he studied at RMIT on campus towards a Certificate IV in IT. From studying Introduction to IT, Jinesh wishes to learn the basics of HTML and to learn how to get a website up and running. As he wants to be a Web Developer, this is the perfect place to get new information and study how websites are made.</p>

                        <h2>Shalimay Nichols</h2>
                        <p>Shalimay is half Filipino and half Australian. Although she grew up in Australia, Shalimay still embraces the Filipino culture and celebrates their events and traditions. Shalimay graduated high school in 2014 and decided to work in dental assisting where she obtained certification and worked for four years. Although a really interesting and rewarding field to be in, Shalimay’s interest in games began to grow into something more of what she wanted to start a career in. Shalimay studied a Diploma of Game Development which gave her a fundamental understanding of programming which has then led her to study a bachelor of IT at RMIT university. In her spare time, Shalimay likes to either sew, play games with her friends, go for hikes, watch game playthroughs or learn something new. She also has three guinea pigs and a cat which keep her very busy.

                        Shalimay’s IT interest started from games. Shalimay wanted to know how they worked and how they were made so maybe one day she could make my own. Whilst learning programming she had a realisation that this is the future. That if she doesn't learn something that so heavily influences the world around us, she would get left behind. Shalimay feels she must adapt to the world around her and future-proof herself. So, it’s lucky in a way it’s genuinely something she enjoys and is interested in. Shalimay likes efficiency. If there’s an easier way to do things, she wants to know or be able to figure it out. She also likes to design things and IT covers all aspects of these interests as IT includes everything from making things work to creating the user experience.

                        Although limited, Shalimay’s experience in IT mainly stems from game development. Shalimay has had a lot of involvement in the process of developing games like creating the UI (User Interface), creating stories, programming, developing the user experience, learning how to use different software such as GitHub, Blender, Visual Studio, Unity, SourceTree, Photoshop, and Audacity. Shalimay has done some game testing; she has recorded and presented data in spreadsheets that explains whether a game is balanced or not and she has very briefly touched on artificial intelligence and augmented reality.</p>

                        <h2>Benjamin Duke</h2>
                        <p>Ben was born and raised in country Victoria. In his younger years, his parents worked on sheep farms. Around age 9-14 Andy’s father managed pig farms. As a result, Ben was home schooled from grade 5 until re-entering school halfway through year 10. Ben did not complete year 10 and moved straight into work as a retail assistant where he completed ten years in various roles.

                          A hobby of Ben’s to this day which began at an early age is gym, health and fitness. This led to the next detour in Ben’s life. Ben completed Certificates 3 and 4 in Personal Training and became a CrossFit powerlifting coach/Personal Trainer. This led to him working for a CrossFit gym which he eventually managed for a further three years. However, that business was sold so he decided to change direction in life again and head back into retail whilst beginning the journey to get into university. This journey began by completing approximately two years of steps which began with him swapping and changing degrees. However, Ben has finally started a degree he is ready to sink his teeth into at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). A fun fact about Ben is that he likes to mountain bike - specifically downhill mountain biking. Ben has also been sky diving and likes to think he’s a bit of a thrill-seeker.

                          Ben’s interest in IT did not begin until later in life due to not having a PC (personal computer) until around the age of 12. His interest was first peaked around the age of 18 when his best mate decided to undertake an IT degree. Up to that point he had never considered university or further study to be a possibility. However, it was still approximately another decade before he would decide to make the jump into further study. By this time his best mate had begun what is now a successful career with the Department of Defence as a Network Engineer. Along the way he developed an excellent group of friends with a passionate interest in IT. Furthermore, if that was not already enough to push him in the direction of IT, Ben's current girlfriend and soon-to-be wife (fingers crossed) also has a passion for game development and has recently completed a Diploma in game development. She is now also embarking on a journey to complete a degree in IT. With all this passion and interest in IT all around him, it was only a matter of time before Ben's interest was a sparked to the point where he would enrol in this current degree with RMIT.

                          Ben’s experience in IT is limited although he enjoys playing games and talking to his mates about it. Although Ben's tech skills are limited, he does however possess many crossover skills from multiple team leadership roles in his earlier careers. For example, he has a strong skill set in conflict resolution, team motivation, and overall time management of large group-oriented tasks. This experience is due to the multiple management roles he has held over the years.</p>
